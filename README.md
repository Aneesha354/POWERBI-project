# POWERBI-project
Performed data analysis using POWERBI, where I learned how to interpret and analyse the business requirements, Through this project, I understood that dashboards are not just about being visually impressive - they play a key role in simplifying complex data and making it easier to understand.
Data Analysis Themes:

How many people are there in each department?
Gender distribution by department
Age spread of our staff 
Min / max / average salary in each department
Top earners in each country
performance Spread
Company growth trend
Employee Filter (by starting letter)
Performance vs. Salary
India vs. New Zealand - quick scorecard

Developed interactive dashboards for various data analysis themes, utilizing measures and calculations in Power BI to enhance insights and support data-driven decision-making.
