# POWERBI-project
Performed data analysis using POWERBI, where I learned how to interpret and analyse the business requirements.<br/>
Through this project, I understood that dashboards are not just about being visually impressive - they play a key role in simplifying complex data and making it easier to understand.<br/>
Data Analysis Themes:<br/>

How many people are there in each department?<br/>
Gender distribution by department<br/>
Age spread of our staff <br/>
Min / max / average salary in each department<br/>
Top earners in each country<br/>
performance Spread<br/>
Company growth trend<br/>
Employee Filter (by starting letter)<br/>
Performance vs. Salary<br/>
India vs. New Zealand - quick scorecard<br/>
