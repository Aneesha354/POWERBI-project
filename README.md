Performed data analysis using POWERBI, where I learned how to interpret and analyse the business requirements, Through this project, I understood that dashboards are not just about being visually impressive - they play a key role in simplifying complex data and making it easier to understand.
Data Analysis Themes:

Gender distribution by department
Age spread of our staff 
Min / max / average salary in each department

Company growth trend
Employee Filter (by starting letter)
